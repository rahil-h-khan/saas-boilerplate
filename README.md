# 🚀 SaaS Boilerplate with FastAPI

A scalable and production-ready SaaS boilerplate built with FastAPI, MongoDB, Redis, and JWT-based authentication. This project provides a solid foundation for building multi-tenant SaaS applications with features like user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), password reset, and more.

## 🛠 Project Overview

🌟 Why This Project?

Building a SaaS product from scratch involves repetitive yet crucial features like authentication, user management, and access control. This boilerplate helps you kickstart your SaaS journey without reinventing the wheel.

📌 Key Features

✅ User Authentication (JWT-based, Secure)
✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
✅ Password Reset
✅ MongoDB as Primary Database (Scalable & Flexible)
✅ Redis for Session Management & Caching (Fast & Efficient)
✅ Environment-based Configuration (.env Support)
✅ Docker Support (Coming Soon 🚀)

## 🛠 Core Functionalities

- 1️⃣ User Authentication
	•	Secure JWT-based authentication.
	•	Password hashing with bcrypt.
	•	User registration & login.
	•	Redis-based session management for optimizing authentication.

- 2️⃣ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	•	Assign roles like Admin, User, Manager.
	•	Restrict API access based on permissions.

- 3️⃣ Password Reset
	•	Users can request a password reset (without email).
	•	Secure password update mechanism.

- 4️⃣ Redis for Session Management & Caching
	•	Stores active JWT tokens for session tracking.
	•	Prevents unauthorized access after logout.
	•	Improves performance with caching for frequently accessed data.

- 5️⃣ Database (MongoDB)
	•	Uses MongoDB as the primary database.
	•	Stores user information & roles securely.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
	•	FastAPI (Python Web Framework)
	•	MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
	•	Redis (Session Management & Caching)
	•	Pydantic (Data Validation)
	•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens) (Authentication)
	•	Bcrypt (Password Hashing)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

🔹 Multi-Tenancy Support (Separate Workspaces for Users)
🔹 Subscription & Payment Integration (Stripe/PayPal)
🔹 Dockerized Deployment
🔹 Admin Dashboard for User Management
🔹 WebSockets for Real-Time Features
